  <h1> Gentrification in Harlem, New York </h1>
  <p id="harlem-essay">
    Harlem is a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York. Harlem is rich in culture and history. Harlem has been home to many
    people for almost a century. Harlem is also one of many neighborhoods in the US suffering gentrification. The
    Merriam-Webster dictionary defines gentrification as “a process in which a poor area (as of a city) experiences an
    influx of middle-class or wealthy people who renovate and rebuild homes and businesses and which often results in an
    increase in property values and the displacement of earlier, usually poorer residents.” Harlem was once a low-income
    neighborhood, but gentrification has radically transformed it economically and culturally, causing its long-time
    residents to depart.
    <br>
    <br>
    During the Great Migration - when black people were moving from the South to the North to escape the racism and
    prejudice in the South - many black people moved to New York. Manhattan, specifically in the neighborhood of Harlem,
    was becoming home to thousands of African Americans. Somewhere between the end of World War 1 and the mid-1930s, the
    Harlem Renaissance was born. The National Museum of African American History and Culture stated:
    <br>
    <br>
    The Harlem Renaissance encompassed poetry and prose, painting and sculpture, jazz and swing, opera, and dance. What
    united these diverse art forms were their realistic presentation of what it meant to be black in America, what
    writer Langston Hughes called an “expression of our individual dark-skinned selves,” and a new militancy in
    asserting their civil and political rights.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was not until the late 1990s that gentrification was evolving rapidly. Places of cultural significance became
    commercial areas, and even though monetarily they were doing well, the people of Harlem were not happy with this.
    For example, 125th street, a street with much cultural significance, is now crowded with fast food restaurants and
    retail chain stores.
    <br>
    <br>
    In Harlem, and many other neighborhoods, gentrification was happening because wealthy investors would buy buildings
    for housing and then charge rent that an average resident would not be able to afford. Retail chains would move into
    the area, and it appealed to newcomers. It was beginning to be very challenging for long-time residents to continue
    to live there. However, for the residents who could afford to live in Harlem, their neighborhood would prove to get
    better. The neighborhood’s living conditions were more refined because it was safer than before and better
    maintained. Additionally, more money was going towards funding city plans and development.
    <br>
    <br>
    Gentrification can be combated by passing legislation that allows fair housing. For example, if the city pushed for
    more middle-income housing. Lessening or freezing the property taxes that long-time residents pay, is a policy that
    could greatly benefit thousands of people. In addition to that, we could try to restrain making luxury-development
    in that neighborhood which is at risk. However, this may not make such a big change in Harlem, specifically because
    they’ve already made many luxury developments. Other than a few policies that stop landlords from abusing their
    power over their tenants there's not much that can be done for Harlem.
    <br>
    <br>
    I've lived in Oakland my whole life. Oakland is the only place I’ve ever called home. I genuinely believe that I
    couldn’t imagine growing up in another city. It’s shaped me into the person I am today, leaving is something that I
    could only ever do on my own terms. If I were forced out of my home because I could no longer afford to live here, I
    would try to be hopeful about my new home. However, I don't know if I could continue to be optimistic once living in
    a different city. A city where I don’t recognize the style of graffiti on walls of abandoned buildings. To move to a
    city where I don’t know the streets based on the stores that I grew up going to. I would be angry that I had to move
    out of the place in which I became a person knowing that someone else was going to move in. With time, hopefully, I
    would feel better about leaving behind Oakland. I wish for the people that had to leave their homes in Harlem to one
    day find the same comfort in their new homes.
    <br>
    <br>
    Harlem is no longer the neighborhood it once was. Harlem which, at a point in time, wore its culture and history on
    its sleeve, has to deal with its people leaving. The long-time residents of Harlem left their home, however, by that
    point, it didn’t really feel like their home anymore. Gentrification was the reason why many lost their homes, but
    also the reason why many had their homes bettered.
