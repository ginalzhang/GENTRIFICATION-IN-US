  <h1>Gentrification in Hawai’i</h1>
  <p id="hawaii-essay">Many people know Hawaii for its beautiful coast. It attracts many tourists and gives a cozy feel
    of living locally. Although this is what gives its popularity, it's also causing gentrification within the state.
    Gentrification is a process in which residents of lower-income neighborhoods are forced out of their homes and
    replaced by much wealthier people. As Hawai’i receives wealthy entrepreneurs, house prices land higher than they
    ever were before, opening a door for Hawaii to learn from other areas that have come up with a solution for
    gentrification.
    <br>
    <br>
    Over the years, Hawaii has been seen as a popular place to tour and visit. As tourists visit the 50th state and see
    its beautiful beaches, its nice weather, and its amazing wildlife. Others have decided that it would be nice to live
    there instead. People such as Oprah Winfrey, Pierre Omidyar, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, to name a few, have
    moved and settled in Hawaii to live there. There has been an increase in wealthy entrepreneurs moving to Hawaii
    since it gives these people a bit of safety and isolation from the public eye. Although these people have come to
    Hawaii to seek some sort of privacy, it has also skyrocketed the house prices in their area. Leaving the
    gentrification that was there before, worse.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hawaii has been seeing house prices get higher, leaving locals to decide for themselves if they can handle it.
    According to InvisblePeople, 15,000 people in Hawaii are homeless and 1,500 - 2,000 are chronically homeless
    (meaning people with a mental or physical health issue who have been homeless for at least six months). As more
    entrepreneurs come, house prices get higher. Increasing the population of homeless people as they are not able to
    pay the high price. “More than 600 homes sold for $3 Million or above in the first 3 quarters of 2021, double the
    number of a previous record set in 2017” states TheRealDeal.
    <br>
    <br>
    Hawai’i isn't the only place that is experiencing gentrification. There are other areas that are trying to fight it
    as well. Some areas have found solutions. In New York, a man named Samuel Stein focuses on gentrification and urban
    planning. He came up with a solution that might help fight gentrification. He suggested that instead of gentrifying
    the city and calling it progress, an option would be to simply use the approach in wealthier white neighborhoods,
    which would have a dramatically different impact. He adds more to this to Truthout:
    <br>
    <br>
    “Strengthening preservation ordinances to protect working-class neighborhoods from predatory development;
    Regulations to prevent frequent and severe rent increases that price out lower-income residents;
    Policies that facilitate the transfer of land and property in mortgage default to the city for housing rather than
    to speculators for profit.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Overall, gentrification isn't a good thing. Most people know it, especially the government. We should set boundaries
    for the wealthy and think about the people who work low-income jobs. We could do this by lowering housing prices to
    accommodate their monthly wage. Or keep the costs and raise the job pay instead. What do you think we should do?
