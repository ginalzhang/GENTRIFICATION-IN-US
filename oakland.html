  <h1>The Gentrification of Oakland</h1>
  <p>Have you ever heard of the term “gentrification''? Gentrification is a circumstance of affluent inhabitants
    relocating to poverty-stricken communities to take advantage of the lower. Generally speaking, the term
    gentrification had been born in 1960, where Ruth Glass had created the term. The height of gentrification in Oakland
    occurred around the 2010s, but it had already begun in the late 70’s. Gentrification is a prominent and complex
    subject that dominates Oakland that heavily influences each and every citizen currently residing within this city.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some effects of gentrification so far are citizens being misplaced, encouraging prejudicial etiquette, and a center
    of attention in creating areas that eliminate impoverished individuals. According to Oakland Wiki, “Gentrification
    in Oakland is an incredibly divisive issue. Many residents feel powerless to affect it and for many people it's
    unclear how to stop displacement. (1)” This means that gentrification has been prevalent in Oakland for many years,
    and that gentrification has affected the citizens by providing them with a feeling of being vulnerable to the
    growing gentrification of their neighborhood. Since citizens do not have the authority to control this expanding
    gentrification, they continue to be affected by witnessing the dismantling of their city’s abundant culture that
    Oakland, the greatest diverse metropolis in California, has continually existed to be pleased of possessing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some dominating mainstream businesses and political leaders express perplexion towards the idea of eliminating
    gentrification because they believe it is net positive since it guides Oakland into district development and
    enlarged elevation of private enterprise happenings. However, the effects of gentrification are more damaging than
    benefiting. According to Maria Poblet, Wendy Georges of the Oakland City Council has said that “the number of
    African Americans in Oakland decreasing by nearly half between 1990-2011, and how home ownership dropped from 50% to
    25% and the decline of this population by 17 percentage points – from 43% to 26% — “the largest drop of any
    population group.”(1)” This means that minorities of the community are being impacted negatively by the effects of
    gentrification, leading to the decrease of African Americans residing in Oakland and the increase in unsheltered
    citizens of the minority lacking shielded and sufficient housing.
    <br>
    <br>
    The gradual increase of housing prices and advancement of local stores have greatly discouraged citizens, especially
    impoverished minorities, to reside in Oakland. According to Natalie Orenstein, a resident had responded in a survey
    saying, “Those of us who aren’t wealthy find fewer and fewer affordable places to shop, and almost no affordable
    places to live. (1)” This means that gentrification has been raising the price of residential housing and the
    overall affordability of living, meaning that it is difficult for original citizens to continue surviving in a
    neighborhood that is drastically affected by gentrification. Eventually, when gentrification has reached the point
    where an individual can no longer manage to make ends meet, they are forced out of their homes, leading to an
    increase in homelessness. According to Dave Boon, a resident of Oakland for a period of 10 years, “Pretty much every
    house on my block has changed hands from Black to white, (1)” Dave Boon’s statement is one of the many encounters of
    a minority experiencing the racial change and domination of the majority that shoves the minority out of the
    picture.
    In conclusion, citizens are heavily affected by gentrification by the increase of housing prices, the majority
    overshadowing the minority, and misplacing citizens. Some ways we can stop or decrease the effects of gentrification
    are by controlling the fluctuating housing rates and by constructing more reasonably priced households. Another way
    to regulate the effects of gentrification is by listening to every resident when making decisions about the
    assembling and adjustments of neighborhoods. That way, citizens will not feel unheard or helpless when it comes to
    how gentrification impacts their life. Additionally, if we protect certain low-income neighborhoods from
    gentrification, citizens will not have to worry about relocating to a different location.
